     * F2: immediate removal — since v1.0.5 (fix #6) an ordered,
     * idempotent, failure-tolerant TEARDOWN, not a bare
     * `clearDeviceOwnerApp`.
     *
     * Why: removal used to clear the owner and nothing else. The live
     * accessibility service still held its enforcement configuration,
     * and when the system tore components down — above all during the
     * uninstall that follows — its accessibility-loss lockdown fired
     * from the main thread inside the package manager's own removal
     * operation: synchronously suspending every controlled package and
     * adding DISALLOW_INSTALL_APPS mid-uninstall. Devices froze
     * (system UI stuck) until the watchdog rebooted them, after which
     * the uninstall succeeded.
     *
     * Order (each step isolated: a failure is recorded in the report
     * and never aborts the remaining steps):
     *  1. `flag` — persist "removal in progress" FIRST: disarms the
     *     accessibility-loss lockdown and policy re-application for the
     *     whole teardown (the intentional-disable guard is armed too,
     *     as a second line of defence).
     *  1b. `lockdown` — end any active full-phone lockdown while the
     *     app is still owner (its DPM releases need owner power) and
     *     cancel the armed lockdown window-start alarms and the
     *     focus-schedule / snooze / pre-reminder alarms. A lockdown
     *     active at removal time would otherwise survive the teardown
     *     with its record, end alarm and kiosk allowlist still armed
     *     and no automatic exit (the end receiver is inert forever
     *     once the removal flag is permanent).
     *  2. `focus` — stop the focus service, end any focus session
     *     (releases its suspensions/restrictions and cancels its
     *     alarm), cancel the focus notification.
     *  3. `policies` — zero the dedicated DPM device policies (screen
     *     capture, camera, status bar, keyguard features) and the
     *     notification-permission grant state, each verified by its
     *     getter (v1.0.5 field-failure fix: these surfaces are NOT in
     *     the user-restriction bundle, so the shipped teardown — which
     *     only cleared bundle state — never touched them).
     *  4. `privateDns` — if a specified-host global private DNS was
     *     set by this app, reset it to the platform default
     *     (opportunistic) and verify.
     *  5. `unsuspend` — release every package that is actually
     *     suspended (authoritative per-package probes, chunked).
     *  6. `restrictions` — clear every user restriction in the app's
     *     complete key list (NOT only the keys the live bundle happens
     *     to read back as true — the shipped read-back-only step is
     *     the field failure's second root cause), then verify the
     *     admin bundle holds no true key at all. The set that was in
     *     force is remembered for the post-removal residue check.
     *  7. `unhide` — unhide every hidden package; drop the local
     *     hidden records so nothing re-hides them later.
     *  8. `uninstallBlocks` — lift every uninstall block.
     *  9. `appRestrictions` — clear the per-app restriction bundles
     *     this app applied (the browser URL blocklists).
     *  10. `notifications` — cancel ALL of this app's notifications
     *     (focus, usage warnings, any channel) and reset the
     *     usage-warning notifier's shown/dismissed state. The shipped
     *     teardown never did this: a 5-minute usage-warning
     *     notification survived a "complete" removal in the shade.
     *  11. `clearOwner` — only now `clearDeviceOwnerApp`, verified by
     *     re-reading the owner state.
     *  12. `removeAdmin` — drop Device Admin immediately after
     *     clearing owner (Batch D root cause 1: `clearDeviceOwnerApp`
     *     alone leaves the admin active, and an active admin blocks
     *     uninstall for ~3 minutes). A bounded retry ladder (3 s,
     *     re-issue, 5 s, re-issue, 5 s = 13 s) that THROWS with the
     *     waited time when the admin never clears — a stuck admin is
     *     a first-class failure now, never a silent false-success.
     *  13. `tornDown` — re-assert the permanent torn-down flag.
     *  14. `stopAccessibility` — stop the accessibility service
     *     cleanly (its `onUnbind` lockdown is already disarmed by
     *     step 1, so nothing fires while the system tears down).
     *  14b. `colourModes` — release any enforced colour modes and
     *     verify every daltonizer key came back to its pre-filter
     *     value (Batch C: a filter left enforced after removal would
     *     leave the phone grey with no app left to switch it off).
     *  15. `verify` — POST-removal verification with reads that work
     *     without admin rights: owner still gone, admin inactive,
     *     none of the restriction keys that were in force at teardown
     *     start still true in the CALLING USER's effective restriction
     *     bundle (UserManager, no admin needed), screen capture
     *     allowed, and no app notification still posted. Any residue
     *     fails this step, so the result dialog can never print a
     *     clean success while a surface persists. A surviving
     *     lockdown record is residue too (step 1b ends it while still
     *     owner). (Once ownership is surrendered the app can no longer
     *     clear residue itself — the dialog says so, and the Config
     *     tab's residue check says re-provisioning is the route back
     *     to clearing power.)
     *
     * Worst case (deadlock re-audit fix E): the native call is bounded
     * by construction — clearOwner 2 s + removeAdmin 13 s + verify 2 s
     * + the per-package censuses (chunked, bounded by the installed-app
     * count) ≈ 25–30 s on a several-hundred-app device. The Dart side
     * raises its display cap to 45 s so the spinner never stops
     * polling while a legitimate teardown is still running, and a
     * process kill mid-teardown is recoverable: step 1's flags are
     * committed first and the teardown is idempotent, so the user can
     * re-run it (the half-torn-down re-run path, whose owner-only
     * steps report `skipped` and whose dialog names re-provisioning
     * as the route back).
     *  16. `flagClear` — a no-op by design (Batch D): the removal
     *     disarm is PERMANENT. The flag is never cleared in the
     *     teardown — clearing it here would re-arm the accessibility
     *     lockdown while the system is still tearing down (Batch D
     *     root cause 2). The flags are reset only by a fresh
     *     provisioning (`AdminReceiver.onEnabled`,
     *     `ShizukuProvisioning.verifyProvisioning`). Every step is
     *     idempotent, so a retry is safe.
     *
     * Threading: the channel handler dispatches on a background
     * executor, so none of this runs on the main thread; the
     * per-package work is probe-driven and the suspension calls are
     * chunked (50 packages per binder call).
