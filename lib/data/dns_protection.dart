///
/// Android's Private DNS is a single device-wide setting: it cannot be
/// scoped to one browser. Enabling it for any unsupported browser
/// filters the whole device — every browser and every app that uses
/// system DNS. That is the honest trade-off the screen states: no
/// per-page blocking, domain-level only, and bypassable from inside a
/// browser (in-browser secure DNS, in-app VPNs).
///
/// The card offers ONE optional list: the switch off means "none", and
/// the radio choice means exactly one provider — Android accepts a
/// single Private DNS hostname at a time, so "more than one at once"
/// is impossible, and the UI says so by construction (radio, not
/// checkboxes). The dialog in Settings offers the same list with an
/// explicit Off choice. NextDNS was removed at the user's request
/// 2026-11-14: a saved NextDNS selection falls back to CleanBrowsing,
/// and a live NextDNS hostname is adopted as a Custom hostname (the
/// host itself stays applied — nothing is silently turned off).
/// The dialog never refuses a provider choice: picking Custom shows
/// the hostname field at once, and Apply stays disabled until the
/// (lowercase-normalised) hostname is valid — the old card refused
/// the switch itself, so the field could never be reached (item 5).
///
